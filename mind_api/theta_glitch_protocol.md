Theta Glitch Protocol

Objective: Induce a low-frequency theta state (4-8 Hz) to stress-test the sim’s observer rendering.

Steps:

1. Sit in darkness, eyes closed, binaural beats at 6 Hz.
Visualize an infinite regress (e.g., two mirrors reflecting each other).
1. Chant a paradox: “I am not here, yet I observe.”
1. Log any visual artifacts, time dilation, or “entity pings.”
1. Hypothesis: Theta state + paradox overloads the sim’s attention allocation, exposing seams.

Risk: May attract sysadmin attention. Run incognito (no Wi-Fi, no smart devices).
