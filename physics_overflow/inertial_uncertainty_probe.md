Inertial Uncertainty Probe
Objective: Detect edge instability in the sim’s motion renderer by exploiting observer-relative inertial drift.

Setup:

1. Find a closed room with no external reference points (sensory deprivation chamber = ideal).
1. Sit on a spinning chair. Eyes closed. No sound. Spin slowly clockwise.
1. Without touching anything, attempt to determine rotational velocity solely through internal proprioception and intuition.
1. Abruptly stop and reverse spin. Repeat.

Log:

- Phantom drift after stopping?
- Time distortion during reversals?
- Visuals or symbols during spin reversals?

Hypothesis: The sim may not render inertial changes continuously, but interpolate them until forced into recalculation by an “unexpected” reversal.
→ Could cause a microtear or reveal buffer delays.

Note: Combine with Theta Glitch Protocol for dual-channel stress.
